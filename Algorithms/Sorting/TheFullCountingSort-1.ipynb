    "      This code defines a function called \"countSort\" that takes in a single parameter, \"arr\", which is a list of strings that are associated with integers.\n",
    "\n",
    "      The first line of the function iterates through the first half of the \"arr\" list and replaces the second element of each sublist (the string) with a dash ('-').\n",
    "\n",
    "      The next line sorts the \"arr\" list based on the first element of each sublist (the integer) using a lambda function.\n",
    "\n",
    "      Finally, the last line prints each second element of the sublists (the strings) in the sorted order.\n",
