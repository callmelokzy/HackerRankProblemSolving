    "Task: Given two integers, l and r, find the maximal value of a xor b, where a and b satisfy the following condition: l<= a<=b<=r\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Working: \n",
    "    The algorithm starts by initializing the variable max_xor to 0 and a loop that iterates through the integers from l to r. Inside the loop, the max_xor is updated by using the bitwise XOR operator (^) to take the XOR of the current value of max_xor and the current integer in the loop.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Then it initialize a variable res with 1 and enters a while loop which will run as long as res is less than or equal to max_xor. Inside the while loop, the res is left shifted by 1 (i.e. res = res << 1) each time the loop runs.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    After the while loop the function returns the value of res-1, which is the maximum possible XOR value that can be obtained by using any two integers in the range of l and r.\n",
